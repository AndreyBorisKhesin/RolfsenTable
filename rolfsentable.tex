\begin{paperabs}
The list of knots with up to 10 crossings is commonly referred to as the Rolfsen
Table.
The concepts behind the calculation of this list are rather hard to implement.
This paper presents a way to generate the Rolfsen table in a simple, clear, and
reproducible manner.
The methods we use are similar to those used by J.~Hoste, M.~Thistlethwaite, and
J.~Weeks in \cite{htw}.
The difference between our methods comes from the fact that \cite{htw} uses more
complicated methods to be able to find all the knots with up to 17 crossings,
while our approach demonstrates a simpler way to find the knots up to 10
crossings.
We do this by generating all planar diagrams with up to 10 crossings and
applying several simplifications to group the knot diagrams into equivalence
classes.
From these diagrams, we generate the full list of candidate knots and reduce it
with several sets of moves.
Lastly, we use invariants to show that every remaining diagram is a diagram of a
distinct knot, proving that there are exactly 250 knots with 10 crossings or
fewer.
Though the algorithms used could be made more efficient, readability was chosen
over speed for simplicity and reproducibility.

\papersec{Introduction}

The Rolfsen table is the list of the 250 knots with 10 crossings or fewer.
Here we attempt to generate it and prove its completeness using a computer
algorithm.
To do this, we begin by considering which knot diagrams could potentially be
included in the table.
There are only a finite number of ways to draw a knot diagram with a given
number of crossings.
Additionally, many of these knot diagrams are \textit{reducible}, meaning that
they can be transformed into equivalent knot diagrams with a smaller number of
crossings.

The list of all knots with a certain number of crossings has been generated for
knots of up to 10 crossings several times in the past and has even been
generated for up to 17 crossings (see \cite{htw}).
This computation is far too involved to be done by hand and was made possible by
using a computer.
To demonstrate a method of generating the Rolfsen table, we created a simple
program for finding all 250 knots with up to 10 crossings (partially sacrificing
efficiency).

\paperfig{Moves}{}
{The 6 moves that we use to construct the Rolfsen table, as well as the second
Reidemeister move.
The letter $R$ is used to denote a tangle with an appropriate number of strands.
If the letter $R$ appears in a different orientation it is because the move
caused the corresponding part of the knot diagram to flip.}

There are far more than 250 knot diagrams with up to 10 crossings, even after
only irreducible knot diagrams are considered.
The reason for this is that there are several moves (see \figMoves) that can
transform one knot diagram into an equivalent one.
Two knot diagrams are \textit{equivalent} if and only if there exists a series
of such moves that transforms one of the diagrams into the other.\\

\paperfig{Trefoil}{
\svgsize{right}{0.4\columnwidth}\hfill\svgsize{left}{0.4\columnwidth}
\begin{center}Right\hspace{0.5\columnwidth}Left\end{center}}
{The right-handed trefoil and the left-handed trefoil.
These knots are considered equivalent for our purposes as they are mirror images
of each other.
However, it is important to note that no series of moves can transform one of
these into the other, so while they are not equivalent knots, we only include
one of them in the Rolfsen table.}

The first manner in which the list of knot diagrams is simplified is by
eliminating knot diagrams that are mirror images of each other.
For example, the right-handed and left-handed trefoils are not equivalent as it
is impossible to turn one into the other (see \figTrefoil).
Only one of the two is included in the Rolfsen table.
The notation we used to represent a knot diagram does not encode the handedness
of the knot so this is not an issue.

\papersvg{Composite}{composite}
{An example of a composite knot diagram.
This knot diagram can be cut along the dotted line into two knot factors, $T$
and $T'$.
Both $T$ and $T'$ can be cut along one of their edges to create the pairs of
ends $A$ and $B$, as well as $A'$ and $B'$, respectively.
If $A$ is then joined to $A'$ and $B$ to $B'$, the resulting knot is knot
composition of $T$ and $T'$, which are now its knot factors.
Knot diagrams that cannot be decomposed into two such knot factors are prime and
are the kind of knot diagrams that we want to include in our final list.}

For any two knot diagrams $T$ and $T'$, we can cut $T$ at some point to create
ends $A$ and $B$ and we can cut $T'$ at some point to create ends $A'$ and $B'$.
Joining $A$ to $A'$ and $B$ to $B'$ results in one larger knot, $R$.
We would say that $T$ and $T'$ \textit{knot factors} of $R$.
This commutative operation is \textit{knot composition}.
Knots that cannot be decomposed into two \textit{knot factors} other than
themselves and the unknot are called \textit{prime}.
If they can, they are called \textit{composite} (see \figComposite).
Only prime knots are included in the final list.

Lastly, out of every set of equivalent knot diagrams, up to not only
Reidemeister moves but several other minor conditions that will be described
later, only one is included in the Rolfsen table.

\papersec{MDT Codes}

The first thing we need to do is to establish is a way to efficiently represent
a knot diagram that is relatively easy for both humans and computers to work
with.

In \cite{htw}, a notation is introduced to represent an $n$-crossing knot
diagram with $n$ integers.
This notation is called a DT code.
Its density and simplicity make it convenient for our purposes.

For any given knot diagram, its representation in this notation is constructed
as follows.
We start by picking an arbitrary point on one of the knot diagram's edges as
well as an arbitrary direction along that edge.
We then move around the knot diagram, following each edge until we return to our
starting point.
If we were to travel along a knot diagram with $n$ crossings, we will pass each
crossing twice, once under and once over.
Each time we pass a crossing, we consider the number of crossings that we
have encountered so far and write it down at the crossing that we are passing.
In other words, when we encounter our first crossing, we write down the number 1
at that point.
It is important to distinguish between writing the number on the upper or the
lower strand of a crossing.
If we passed the first crossing along the upper strand, we write down the number
1 on the upper strand and vice versa.
Continuing, we would write down the number 2 at the next crossing we encounter.
We would end up writing each number from 1 to $2n$ exactly once.
Furthermore, these numbers would be grouped into $n$ pairs, as there would be
two numbers written at each of the $n$ crossings.

\begin{paperclm}
Grouping the values from 1 to $2n$ as described above means that each pair will
contain one even number and one odd number.
\end{paperclm}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Claim]
Any pair of closed curves has an even number of intersections.
For the sake of contradiction, suppose that some pair ($a$, $b$) satisfied
$a\equiv b~(\hspace{-1.5ex}\mod~2)$.
We will now define two curves.
The first is the curve that we traced out when we started at $a$ and ended at
$b$.
This curve is closed as $a$ and $b$ are located at the same crossing.
The second curve is the rest of the knot, which is closed for the same reason.
We can construct it by starting at $b$ and following the knot in the same
direction until we come back around to $a$.
To make sure that there is no confusion at the crossing labeled $a$ and $b$, we
can eliminate that crossing and connect the ends of our curves together.
This can be done without adding any intersections as the ends of both curves
cannot be located across the crossing from each other.
Since the curves have an even number of intersections, $2k$, then $b$ must be
exactly $a+2k+1$, which is not possible by our assumption.
Thus, the claim is true.
\end{proof}

The list of pairs has no order, so sorting them in ascending order by looking at
the odd value in each pair does not sacrifice any information.
It then follows that the list of even values, sorted by their corresponding odd
value, is sufficient to fully reconstruct the original list of pairs.\\

\paperfig{Labeled}
{\begin{center}\svgsize{labeled}{0.5\columnwidth}\end{center}}
{The right-handed trefoil with the strands in its crossings labeled from 1 to 6.
The labeling starts at the white circle in the centre of the top edge and
proceeds to the right in the direction of the arrow.
The labeling then continues until all 6 strands at the knot diagram's crossings
are labeled.
We see that the pairs, when sorted in ascending order by their odd value, are
(1, 4), (3, 6), and (5, 2).}

As an example, we show how the DT code is found for the trefoil.
After labeling the trefoil, the pairs are (1, 4), (2, 5) and (3, 6) (see
\figLabeled).
We flip some of the pairs to place all of the odd values first.
Then, the pairs can be ordered by their odd value to get (1, 4), (3, 6), and
(5, 2).
The original pairs can be reconstructed with the sequence (4, 6, 2) as there is
a unique way of reestablishing the odd counterparts to each of the even numbers.
Since this sequence contains only even numbers, storing half of each value works
just as well and makes some computations easier.
Therefore, the trefoil is represented by (2, 3, 1).
We call the notation that stores half of each integer an MDT code (M is for
modified).
The $2\times n$ matrix of pairs is called a EDT code (E is for extended).
The EDT code for the trefoil is $\begin{pmatrix}1&3&5\\4&6&2\end{pmatrix}$.\\

\paperfig{Crossings}{
\begin{center}Crossings\end{center}
\svgsize{positive}{0.33\columnwidth}
\hfill
\svgsize{negative}{0.33\columnwidth}
\begin{center}Right-handed\hspace{0.37\columnwidth}Left-handed\end{center}}
{The right-handed and left-handed crossings.
The crossings get their name from the fact that pointing the thumb of your right
hand along of the strands in the right-handed crossing and curling your fingers
will result in your fingers pointing in the direction of the other strand.
An analogous statement holds for left-handed crossings.
When computing values such as the writhe of a knot diagram, right-handed
crossings are considered positive and left-handed crossings are considered
negative.}

As described so far, this notation only tells us which strands cross which.
What it does not tell us is the handedness of each crossing (see \figCrossings).
In other words, the shape of the knot diagram can be reconstructed, but every
crossing will effectively be blurred out, as it will not be clear which of the
two strands in the crossing is the upper strand and which is the lower strand.
To account for this, we will declare that a crossing is \textit{positive} if,
out of the two values that make up a crossing, the odd one corresponds to the
upper strand of the crossing.
If a crossing is not positive, it is \textit{negative} and we indicate this by
negating the even value in each negative crossing.
For example, if a crossing is marked (17, 34) and the strand labeled 17 passes
above the strand labeled 34, we leave the crossing as is.
On the other hand, if the upper strand is marked 34, we denote the crossing by
the pair (17, -34).

If we were to flip over a knot diagram and look at it from the back, all of the
even values in its MDT code would change sign, so if necessary we negate all the
values in the MDT code to make the leading term positive.
As a result, every knot diagram with $n$ crossings can be represented by a
signed permutation of the numbers from 1 to $n$.

\papersec{Alternating Knots}

By determining which of certain knots, which are called
\textit{alternating knots}, should be included in our final list, we can make
the task of determining the remainder of the list significantly easier.
For this reason, we start by determining which alternating knots should be
included in our reconstruction of the Rolfsen table.

For a given knot diagram, if we were to trace its shape, exactly like when we
were trying to determine the MDT code, and we found that we are always
alternating between passing over crossings along upper strand and under
crossings along lower strands, then we say that this knot diagram is
\textit{alternating}.
We note that being any minimal knot diagram that is equivalent to an alternating
knot diagram will be alternating.
Thus, it makes sense to refer to \textit{alternating knots} as this property is
independent of our choice of knot diagram.

Any knot that is not an alternating knot is a \textit{non-alternating knot}.

\begin{paperclm}{Alternating}
{The MDT codes of alternating knots consist entirely of positive entries.}
\end{paperclm}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Claim]
We know that the first element of our MDT code will be positive by definition.
The first element is thus part of a pair that represents a crossing where the
odd strand passes above the even strand as the first element is positive.
If we were to choose either of the two strands in that crossing and follow them
in either direction to the next crossing, we would find that the strand that
was the upper strand in our starting crossing would now be the lower strand and
vice versa.
This is due to the fact that the knot in question is alternating.

We would also see that since we moved to an adjacent crossing along some strand,
the label of the strand at the first crossing would have the opposite parity of
the label at the second crossing.
For example, the label at the original crossing could have been 1 and the label
at the new crossing will be adjacent to the first one, so it could have been 2.
The difference between 1 and 2 is only 1 so 1 and 2 have opposite parities.

The consequence of this is that if the odd strand was the upper strand in the
first crossing, it would turn into an even strand that is the lower strand in
the adjacent crossing.
An analogous statement is true for the even strand.
Thus, the adjacent crossing would have a positive sign in the MDT code as the
odd strand in the adjacent crossing is the upper stand and the even strand is
the lower strand.
By induction, all of the elements of the MDT code will be positive, proving our
claim.
\end{proof}

Thus, to generate all relevant knot diagrams, it suffices to generate the list
of alternating knots before constructing the non-alternating knots by flipping
the crossings of each of the alternating knots in every possible way.
There would be $2^{n-1}$ ways as the first crossing must remain positive.

There are $10!$ positive permutations with 10 elements so to get fewer than 250
alternating knots with 10 crossings, some must be eliminated.
There are several criteria which we can use to determine which we can use to
determine which alternating knots we should include in our list.
We will first define these criteria, then explain afterwards how to implement a
test that verifies that these criteria are satisfied.

A permutation is eliminated unless it meets \textit{all} of the following
criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A knot diagram can produce different permutations depending on where one
starts numbering and in which direction they proceed.
There are $4n$ ways to choose both a starting point and direction (though for
cases like (2, 3, 1), all such choices result in the same permutation).
A permutation is \textit{minimal} if it is lexicographically smaller than all of
the other $4n-1$ possible permutations of the corresponding knot diagram.
To satisfy this criterion, a permutation must be minimal.

\item The resulting knot diagram is prime.
Since a composite knot diagram can be split into to knot factors, we know that
as we label the knot, we will have to go through all of the crossings of one of
the knot factors before we can move on to the other.
This means that the values from 1 to $2n$ will be split into two consecutive
subsequences since the values in each subsequence will be the labels of the
crossings of one of the knot factors.
In a permutation, this would be expressed as a set of $k$ pairs, all $2k$ of
whose values form a consecutive subsequence.
Thus, such a set must not exist in the EDT code for the knot diagram to be prime
(see \figComposite).
This also handily eliminates knot diagrams that contain a kink and could be
simplified with the first Reidemeister move.
The third Reidemeister move and the simplifying direction of the second
Reidemeister move cannot occur in alternating knots (see \figMoves).

\item The permutation encodes a diagram which is realizable.
This means that there must be a way to draw the knot diagram without adding any
intersections beyond the ones encoded in the permutation.
The simplest permutation that fails this test is (2, 4, 1, 5, 3).
It is physically impossible to draw a knot diagram on a plane that would have a
non-realizable permutation as its MDT code.

\item The knot diagram is minimal with respect to flyping.
This means that the knot diagram's minimal permutation must be lexicographically
minimal over all the permutations of knot diagrams connected to our original
diagram via a sequence of flypes (see \figMoves).
\end{enumerate}

\pdfex{candidateknots}

The first two conditions can be used to avoid testing all $n!$ possible
alternating MDT codes.
If we arranged the $n!$ permutations lexicographically and went along checking
each one, it will frequently be possible to skip checking up to $k!$
permutations at a time, where $0\leq k<n$.

Skipping these permutations is made possible as the first two criteria can be
checked directly from the permutation.
If a permutation that fails one of the first two criteria contains a value, or
possibly a string of values, that make the permutation fail this criterion, then
all permutations that contain the same string of digits will also fail this
criterion and do not need to be checked.
Thus, as soon as we find such a permutation, we can increment the last digit of
the offending subsequence, thereby skipping $k!$ permutations ahead, where $k$
is the number of digits left in the permutation after the subsequence.

For the first criterion, a permutation is not minimal if we can find a pair in
our EDT code which are numerically closer together than the leading term and its
odd-valued pair, the number 1.
So if there is a value $x$ in the permutation which is closer to its paired odd
value than the first number in the permutation is to 1, then all permutations
with $x$ in the same position will not be minimal.
This is because starting the enumeration of the knot diagram's strands at the
crossings with the one labeled $x$ (thereby labeling it 1) would result in a
smaller first element in the MDT code, which is not allowed as the knot diagrams
in the table must be minimal.

\pdfex{minimal}

Similarly, if a knot diagram is not prime, this is represented by several
consecutive terms in the permutation, meaning that all permutations obtained by
rearranging the values that come after this sequence would also fail this test.
Checking if a knot is prime or not was described above, we just need to find a
subsequence of 1 to $2n$, such that the all of the numbers paired with the
values of that subsequence form the same subsequence.
In other words, if a knot is composite, its knot factors will contain
consecutive strand labels.
Since two knot factors can never cross, the crossings of a knot factor contain
two elements of that subsequence.
Thus, if the pairs of the values in a subsequence do not contain any values
outside of that subsequence, the knot diagram is not prime.

The third condition is checked with the help of a modified graph planarity
algorithm.
If a 4-valent graph is constructed out of a knot diagram by replacing each
crossing with a vertex and each edge of the knot with an edge in the graph, then
typical planarity tests would frequently give false positives.
There are 4 edges emanating from a crossing, but there are only 2 ways of
arranging them in a valid manner in a knot diagram, but there are 6 ways of
arranging 4 edges around a vertex.
The reason for this is that a strand is not allowed to exit a crossing via an
edge that is adjacent to its incoming edge.
Strands must go directly across a crossing which means that the incoming and
outgoing edges of a strand must be aligned opposite from each other.

We have not yet imposed any restrictions that would tell a graph planarity
algorithm that such cases should not be considered.
Permutations that fail this test do not form a planar knot diagram, but the
graph that is created by making the same connections between vertices is
planar.
The reader can check that the graph formed by the permutation (2, 4, 1, 5, 3) is
planar, yet a knot diagram with such an MDT code is impossible to draw.

\papersvg{Graph}{graph}
{The transformation applied to the knot diagram's graph to determine whether or
not the knot diagram is planar.
We take each vertex in the 4-valent graph and replace it with 4 vertices
connected to each other and to the original edges in a square.
This makes the graph 3-valent and also serves as a proper indicator of the
planarity of the knot diagram's graph.
The reason for this is that a graph should not be accepted as planar if there is
a crossing where the two strands in the crossing enter and leave the crossing
through adjacent edges.
The new 3-valent graph would stop being planar if this were to happen since the
square in the centre would become a non-planar bowtie.}

To solve this problem, it is sufficient to replace each vertex with four
vertices in a square to construct the modified graph of the knot diagram (see
\figGraph).
This preserves the planarity of the two allowable configurations but bars the
other four, as the square would be transformed into a non-planar bowtie shape.
Thus, it suffices to use a regular graph planarity algorithm to check whether
the modified graph of the knot diagram is planar.
If it is not, the permutation fails the third criterion.

\pdfex{knotgraph}

Finally, the fourth condition is checked by using a graph searching algorithm to
find all knot diagrams that can be obtained from a given knot diagram with a
series of flypes (see \figMoves).
From these, we keep only the lexicographically minimal knot diagram.
A flype is represented in a permutation as a pair and two disjoint subsequences
of 1 to $2n$.
The pair is the crossing that effectively gets moved to the other side of the
body that gets flyped.
The two subsequences are the two strands that make up the part of the knot that
is flipped over in the flype.
It is important to note that these subsequences must satisfy several conditions.
The first of these is that all of the numbers in these subsequences must be
paired with other elements of the subsequences.
This is much like the test for whether or not a knot is composite that was
described earlier.
The reason for this condition is that the part of the knot that is flipped must
be what amounts to a two strand knot factor, in the sense that it must not cross
any part of the knot outside of itself.
Additionally, these two subsequences, depending on which way the strands run,
must either start or end with the values adjacent to those of the earlier pair.
Since that pair contains one odd value and even value, we can save time by
ignoring the cases where this rule would be violated.
To find the final list of alternating knots, it is sufficient to just check for
possible connections between knot diagrams via flypes. (TODO CITE)

\pdfex{flype}

Having found all of the knot diagrams that satisfy the four criteria, a complete
list of all of the alternating knots is generated.

\pdfex{alternatingknots}

\papersec{Non-Alternating Knots}

After generating all of the alternating knots, we have an easier time
determining which knot diagrams should be tested to see if they should be
included in our list.
There are $2^{n-1}n!$ signed permutations with a positive leading term.
Of these, we only need to consider those that have the shape of alternating
knots in our list.
What this means is that we only have to consider the $2^{n-1}$ knot diagrams
obtained for each alternating knot in our list by flipping the signs of the
elements of the alternating knot's permutation in every possible way.
There would be $2^n$ ways to do this but the leading term must stay positive.

The overwhelming majority of these knot diagrams are eliminated as they can be
reduced with the second Reidemeister move.
Many of those that remain can be reduced with a (2, 1)--pass or a (3, 2)--pass
(see \figMoves).
We do not consider the (1, 0)--pass as it is the first Reidemeister move.
These pass moves can be found in most reducible knot diagrams.

\pdfex{passreducible}

By considering all knot diagrams that cannot be simplified with either the
second Reidemeister move or a pass move, there are very few reducible knot
diagrams that have not yet been eliminated.
The reason for this is that a reducibility test checking only for these moves
will occasionally give false negatives.
This will be dealt with at a later stage.

\pdfex{validknots}

\papersec{Connections}

Here it is necessary to extend the definition of lexicographic orderings to
signed permutations.
First, a positive permutation always comes before a non-positive permutation.
In other words, alternating knots always come before non-alternating knots.
A non-positive permutation is a permutation that contains at least one negative
term.
Between two non-positive permutations the one that comes first is the one whose
absolute value is lexicographically smaller.
If the absolute values of the permutations are equal, then the permutations are
ordered lexicographically, meaning that the one that has its first negative
value at an earlier first index comes first.
This is the same ordering that was used in \cite{htw}.

\pdfex{knotsort}

Now we need to determine which knot diagrams are equivalent and to take the
lexicographically smallest permutation for each knot.
We do this by examining all knot diagrams which cannot be transformed into
smaller ones with a series of crossing number-preserving moves.
For 10 crossings and fewer, the third Reidemeister move, the 2--pass, and the
flype (see \figMoves) are sufficient to eliminate all but 251 of the knot
diagrams that we had left to consider after removing those that we determined
were reducible.
Applying the third Reidemeister move is preferable to the first two
Reidemeister moves as there are many ways of adding crossings to a knot diagram
but there are only a few ways to apply a move that preserves the crossing number
of a knot diagram.

\pdfex{twopass}

To find equivalent knot diagrams, a graph searching algorithm is implemented.
In our graph, we let each knot diagram be represented by a vertex.
Then, for each knot diagram, we connect its vertex to all the vertices that
represent knot diagrams that the first knot diagram can be transformed into with
a single move (see \figMoves).
If the original knot diagram can be transformed into a knot diagram whose vertex
is not in the graph, that vertex is added to the graph.
This is important for removing the reducible knot diagrams from the graph.

When we are done the vertices of the graph are candidate knot diagrams and the
edges of the graph are moves that connect two different but equivalent diagrams.
Each connected component of the graph consists of a set of equivalent diagrams,
all representing the same knot.

At this point we return to the earlier concern that this graph might contain
some reducible knot diagrams.
Any reducible knot diagram that has not yet been removed is not immediately
reducible, which means that it cannot be reduced with a pass move or the second
Reidemeister move.
However, all such diagrams are equivalent to other diagrams which are
immediately reducible.
Thus, if any of the knot diagrams in a connected component are immediately
reducible, the entire component is removed from the graph.
After this, the graph no longer contains any reducible knot diagrams.

{The two different representations of the same knot,
$10_{161}$, that are commonly referred to as the Perko pair.
These were initially thought to be different knots in Rolfsen's original
tabulation until the error was corrected by Kenneth Perko in 1973.}

To rebuild our list of candidate knots, we take the lexicographically smallest
knot diagram from each connected component of the graph.
The resulting list has 251 knots instead of 250, so it must contain one
duplication.
This duplication is the infamous Perko pair which has a
history of going undetected by tabulators (see \figPerko).

At this point, we face a dilemma for how to narrow down the list to 250 knots.
We could introduce more moves that preserve crossing number such as the Perko
move, a move designed specifically to deal with the Perko pair.
We could also allow moves that change the crossing number such as the first two
Reidemeister moves (see \figMoves).

By allowing use of the first Reidemeister move and allowing the crossing number
to increase to 11, the list can be reduced to 250 knots by executing the
following procedure.

\pdfex{reidemeisterone}

Both knot diagrams in the Perko pair are transformed into knot diagrams with 11
crossings by adding a positive kink into the knot diagram.
Namely, by inserting $k$ into the $k^\text{th}$ position in the MDT code and
added 1 to all of the values in the MDT code that are greater than or equal to
$k$.
The resulting knot diagrams are found to be equivalent under repeated
application of the third Reidemeister move (see \figMoves).

\pdfex{reidemeisterthree}

This produces the full list of the 250 prime knots with 10 crossings or fewer.
All that is left is to show we have not missed any more duplications: pairs of
knot diagrams that are equivalent.

\papersec{Invariants}

Since the computation time is massively increased by examining equivalent knot
diagrams with 11 crossings, it is unreasonable to do this for all 251 knots.
Thus, invariants are used to establish which knot diagrams are definitively not
duplicated in the table to find which knot diagrams form the Perko pair.
If there is a pair of knot diagrams all of whose invariants are equal, their 11
crossing connections are examined and if they are found to be equivalent, the
lexicographically larger knot diagram is removed from the list.
Eventually, the list contains only knot diagrams whose invariants are unique
among the candidates.
Since we know that none of our knot diagrams are reducible and that we have
found all of the alternating knots with no duplications, we just need to check
for pairs among the set of non-alternating knots of a given crossing number.
We use 2 invariants, as one of them is not strong enough and the other is very
slow.
These are the Jones polynomial and the number of colourings of a given knot
diagram.

\pdfex{invariants}

\papersec{Planar Diagram Notation}

To find the Jones polynomial of a given knot diagram, the knot diagram must be
written in planar diagram notation as opposed to as an MDT code.
To find this notation, it is necessary to determine the handedness of each of
the knot diagram's crossings (see \figCrossings).
There are $2^n$ possible ways to set the handedness of the crossings.
Since the only knot diagrams being considered are realizable, it is known that
at least one of these $2^n$ crossing orientations will make the knot diagram
planar.

Since we are trying to compute polynomials of knot diagrams where $n\leq10$,
$2^n\leq1024$, which is, computationally speaking, a small number.
For this reason, we can exhaustively iterate through the $2^n$ crossing
orientations until we find one that creates a planar knot diagram.

To test if the knot diagram with the given crossing orientations is planar, we
apply the same replacement that we used to check whether the knot diagram was
planar (see \figGraph TODO ADD A PROPER DIAGRAM FOR THIS) but we replace each
outer edge with a ribbon, a pair of parallel edges to adjacent vertices, to only
allow 1 of the 6 edge configurations.\\

{A right-handed crossing labeled in planar diagram notation.
The lower incoming edge is labeled $i$ and then the remaining three are labeled
$j$, $k$, and $l$, proceeding counterclockwise from $i$.
The crossing is labeled as $X_{i,j,k,l}$.}

Every crossing is represented in planar diagram notation as $X_{i,j,k,l}$ (see
\figX).
Here, $i$ is the index given to the lower incoming edge and then $j$, $k$, and
$l$ proceed counterclockwise.

The knot diagram is then written as the product of its crossings in planar
diagram notation.
For example, the left-handed trefoil (see \figTrefoil and \figLabeled) is
written as $X_{1,4,2,5}X_{3,6,4,1}X_{5,2,6,3}$.

\papersec{Jones Polynomial}

The Jones polynomial of a knot diagram is computed from the product of its
crossings.\\

{The 0 and 1-smoothings of a right-handed crossing.
The smoothings are comprised of two strands with no directionality.
If every crossing in a knot diagram were replaced by a smoothing, the result
will be an unlink as the knot diagram will be devoid of crossings.
The 0-crossing is formed by connecting the two ends of the lower strand of the
crossing to adjacent ends of the upper strand in the counterclockwise direction.
For the 1-smoothing, the direction is clockwise.}

Every crossing can be \textit{smoothed} in two distinct ways (see
\figSmoothings).
By smoothing a crossing in a particular manner, the polynomial of that smoothing
is multiplied by a coefficient of either $A$ or $B$ for the 0 and 1-smoothings,
respectively.
Since each smoothing is actually a coefficient ($A$ or $B$) multiplied by the
two non-intersecting strands of the smoothing, a strand stitching operation can
be applied to turn a product of $n$ smoothings into an unlink of several
components.
This operation is such that the product of two strands that share an endpoint,
such as the strand from $p$ to $q$, ($p$, $q$), and the strand ($q$, $r$), will
be equal to one strand running between their non-common endpoints, ($p$, $r$) in
this case.
The final result will always be the product of several strands that are closed
loops of the form ($p$, $p$).
Each of these components of the link is given a coefficient of $d$ and thus the
result is a polynomial in $A$, $B$, and $d$.
What we have defined so far is called the Kauffman bracket of a knot diagram
$X$, and is denoted $\langle X\rangle$.
We note that $\langle\bigcirc\rangle=d$ and $\langle$\o$\rangle=1$, where
$\bigcirc$ and \o~represent the unknot and the empty knot, respectively.
Using this notation,a formula for the smoothings of a crossing can be written.

\papereq{BracketPlus}{
\left\langle\begin{matrix}\svgsize{positive}{2em}\end{matrix}\right\rangle
=A\left\langle\begin{matrix}\svgsize{zero}{2em}\end{matrix}\right\rangle
+B\left\langle\begin{matrix}\svgsize{one}{2em}\end{matrix}\right\rangle}{}
\papereq{BracketMinus}{
\left\langle\begin{matrix}\svgsize{negative}{2em}\end{matrix}\right\rangle
=A\left\langle\begin{matrix}\svgsize{one}{2em}\end{matrix}\right\rangle
+B\left\langle\begin{matrix}\svgsize{zero}{2em}\end{matrix}\right\rangle}{}

A given smoothing is a 0-smoothing if the incoming end of the lower strand is
connected to the next end going counterclockwise around the crossing, in other
words, the nearest end on its right.
If it is connected to the end on its left, the resulting smoothing is a
1-smoothing.

Thus, $\langle\svgl{right}\rangle$, the Kaufmann bracket of the right-handed
trefoil can be evaluated.
Note that this trefoil is right-handed so we will only need \eqBracketPlus.
There are 8 ways to smooth the three crossings altogether and unless we apply
three 0-smoothings or three 1-smoothings, there are going to be cases which are
rotationally symmetric and have the same bracket value.
Thus, the bracket of the trefoil can be expanded.

\papereq{TrefoilOne}{\fontsize{9pt}{1em}\selectfont
\langle\svgl{right}\rangle
=A^3\langle\svgl{triple}\rangle
+3A^2B\langle\svgl{double}\rangle
+3AB^2\langle\svgl{single}\rangle
+B^3\langle\svgl{nil}\rangle}{}

Thus, by counting the number of components in each unlink, the remaining
brackets can be evaluated with the corresponding power of $d$.

\papereq{TrefoilTwo}{\fontsize{11pt}{1em}\selectfont
\langle\svgl{right}\rangle
=A^3d^2+3A^2Bd+3AB^2d^2+B^3d^3}{}

To make the Kaufmann bracket invariant over the second and third Reidemeister
moves (see \figMoves), we must set $d+A^2+B^2=0$ and $AB=1$.
To make this invariant over the first Reidemeister move, the whole polynomial
must be multiplied by a coefficient of $(\text-A)^{\text-3w}$ where $w$ is the
writhe of the knot diagram, which is the difference between the number of
right-handed and left-handed crossings in the knot diagram.
Since the resulting polynomial will have a factor of $d$ in every component, the
polynomial is normalized by dividing it by $d$.
Lastly, the result will always be a polynomial in $A^4$ so the rule
$A=q^{\text-1/4}$ (TODO CITE) is applied to result in a Laurent polynomial in
$q$.

\pdfex{writhe}

For the trefoil, these substitutions allow us to transform our equation into a
simpler form.
We get that the writhe, $w$, is equal to 3.
This means that the Jones polynomial for the right-handed trefoil needs to be
multiplied by $\text-A^{\text-9}$.
Applying $d=\text-A^2-B^2$ and $B=A^{\text-1}$, the Jones polynomial of the
trefoil can be found.

\papereq{TrefoilThree}{J(\svgl{right})
=\text-A^{\text-16}+A^{\text-12}+A^{\text-4}}{}

Since the Jones polynomial of the mirror image of a knot diagram is the Jones
polynomial of the original knot diagram with $q$ replaced by $q^{\text-1}$, the
minimal of these two polynomials is taken as the value of the invariant for that
knot diagram.

Applying the $q$ substitution will yield the final version of the Jones
polynomial for the right-handed trefoil.
However, the left-handed trefoil has a smaller Jones polynomial (by degree) so
we state that the Jones polynomial for the trefoil is the Jones polynomial for
the left-handed trefoil.

\papereq{TrefoilJones}{J(\svgl{left})
=\text-q^{\text-4}+q^{\text-3}+q^{\text-1}}{}

\pdfex{jonespolynomial}

\papersec{Knot Colourings}

The Jones Polynomial is a convenient invariant for our purposes as it filters
out the list of candidate knot diagrams almost entirely.
If we use a little additional information about each knot diagram, such as its
crossing number and whether or not it is alternating then the Jones polynomial
only fails to differentiate between two pairs of knots diagrams.
All four of these knot diagrams have 10 crossings and are non-alternating.
We must determine which two of them are the Perko pair, and then only retain one
of them, as well as the two other knot diagrams, in our table.
As all of our old invariants have failed to distinguish between these two pairs
of knot diagrams, a new invariant is required to show this.

As we have very few knot diagrams to analyze, we can spend some additional time
computing a more complicated determinant, in exchange for the guarantee that it
will separate our knot diagrams.
This invariant is the number of \textit{colourings} of the knot diagram with
elements of the permutation group $S_m$, for some $m$.
Such a colouring is an assignment of permutations of $m$ elements to edges of
the knot diagram such that these permutations are the same along any strand of
the knot diagram and such that the product of the four permutations around a
given crossing is equal to the identity permutation.

Two knot diagrams are the same if and only if the number of colourings using
elements of $S_m$ is the same for all natural numbers $m$ (TODO CITE).
Thus, to show that two knot diagrams are different, we need to find a value of
$m$ such that the the invariant produces a different value for the two knot
diagrams.
In other words, the number of ways to colour both of the knot diagrams using
elements of $S_m$ must be different.

It would be incorrect to simply count the number of ways that various values of
$S_m$ can be assigned to all $2n$ edges of the knot diagram.
The reason for that is that the values assigned to edges along a strand must be
the same.
Thus, if we label the values in $S_m$ that we assign to each edge as $i$, $j$,
$k$, and $l$ starting from the incoming lower edge and proceeding
counterclockwise (see \figX), two relations that those four values have to
satisfy can be constructed.

We know that the permutations must be the same along any strand.
Thus, the two edges that form the top strand have the same permutations.

\papereq{Upper}{j=l}{}

We also know that the product of all four permutations around the crossing is
the identity.
However, as we go around the crossing, we have to invert the permutation if the
edge is outgoing instead of incoming.
This means that we can derive an expression for a positive crossing (see
\figCrossings) and replace $j$ and $l$ with $j^{\text-1}$ and $l^{\text-1}$,
respectively.
So for a positive crossing, we get an expression for $i$.

\papereq{Lower}{i=l^{\text-1}kj}{}

Put these together into an all-encompassing equation for each crossing.

\papereq{Both}{i=j^{\text-1}kj}{}

\pdfex{permutationconjugation}

We note that since we are taking the permutation conjugation of $j$ with $k$,
then $i$ and $k$ will have the same cycle lengths.
As any two edges across a crossing have the same cycle lengths, and since we can
follow the path of the knot by going through each crossing, one by one, never
changing cycle lengths, then all of the values for the edges must have the same
cycle lengths.
This simplifies the procedure and gives us a lot more information.
Whereas before we would have had to map edges to $S_m$ and count the total
number of colourings, now they can be mapped to a subset of $S_m$.
If all elements of this subset have the same cycle lengths, then number of
colourings for each such subset can be counted independently.
Thus, instead of ending up with a single number as our invariant, we end up with
$P(m)$ different values, where $P$ is the partition function.
This is due to the fact that an element of $S_m$ can have $P(m)$ different
possible cycle lengths.
Thus, to show that the knot diagrams are different, it suffices for any one of
these $P(m)$ values to differ.

As previously stated, we cannot simply find the number of ways to map edges to
elements of $S_m$.
We need to find as many equations that relate the edges as possible using
\eqUpper and \eqLower.
For knot diagrams with $n$ crossings we have to find equations relating the $2n$
edges.
Finding $n$ such equations is easy with \eqUpper as every crossing has an upper
strand whose two edges must have equal values in $S_m$.
We are going to get another $n$ equations from \eqBoth and we have to combine
the two sets of equations.
We need to find a set of \textit{generators}, edges whose values can be chosen
from $S_m$ independently, for our knot diagram and then find the values for the
remaining edges using \eqUpper and \eqBoth.

To find these generators we need to find the smallest subset of these $2n$ edges
whose values, when plugged into \eqUpper and \eqLower will allow us to determine
the values of all $2n$ edges.
When $n=10$, the set usually contains between 3 and 5 edges.
It is immediately clear that $n$ edges can be derived from the other $n$ by
using \eqUpper.
Thus, we are only interested in finding which of the other $n$ can be
chosen independently.
We create a graph with $2^n$ vertices, where each vertex represents a subset of
our $n$ edges of interest.
For each crossing, we know that by using \eqBoth, knowing $j$, as well as either
$i$ or $k$, is sufficient to reestablish the missing value: $k$ or $i$,
respectively.
Thus, we draw a directed edge from every vertex whose subset $S$ contains $j$
and either $i$ or $k$ to the vertex whose subset is $S\cup\{i,k\}$.
This edge represents the fact that if we are given the values for the elements
of the subset at the first vertex, all of the values for the elements of the
subset of the second vertex can be derived by using \eqBoth.
We then find our generators by taking the connected component containing the
vertex that holds all $n$ values and finding the vertex in that component that
contains the smallest subset.
There will then be a path from the latter vertex, the one containing the
generators, to the former vertex, the one containing all $n$ edges of interest,
that consists of repeatedly applying \eqBoth by deriving one additional value at
a time out of the $n$ we seek.
Then, this will be the order in which the values of the $n$ edges are be
determined.

\pdfex{edgesequence}

Once we have found the generators, we assign to them every possible
combination of values of our chosen subgroup of $S_m$.
We set the generator values, generate the rest of the values for the edges,
and then check that \eqBoth is satisfied for each crossing.
If it is, then the colouring is valid, otherwise, it is not.

\pdfex{validcolouring}

We count the total number of valid colourings and our invariant becomes a list
of size $P(m)$ containing the number of valid colourings of the knot diagram
using elements of $S_m$.
Each element of the array corresponds to a different subset of $S_m$, where all
of the elements in each subset have the same cycle lengths.
Using this invariant, the two knot diagrams that have the same Jones polynomial
can be distinguished from each other.

\pdfex{colourings}

Thus, we have constructed the table containing the 250 knots with 10 crossings
or fewer.

\pdfex{rolfsentable}

\papersec{Knot Graphs}

During our calculation of the Rolfsen table, we have used three crossing
number-preserving moves: the 2-pass, the third Reidemeister move, and the flype
(see \figMoves).
We generated a graph of connections to determine whether a knot diagram was
reducible and whether or not two knot diagrams were equivalent.
By running our algorithms with a different set of knot diagrams, the graph of
connections between all irreducible knot diagrams can be generated.
To do this, we simply replace the set of alternating knots with the set of
candidate knots, which satisfy the same conditions as those for alternating
knots, except for the condition that they must be minimal over flypes.

From these knot diagrams, all of their non-alternating knot diagrams can be
generated, map each diagram to a vertex, connect these vertices with edges
representing 2-passes, third Reidemeister moves, and flypes (see \figMoves), and
remove all connected components that were found to be reducible.

\pdfex{creategraph}

The result will be the full graph of irreducible knot diagrams and their
connections.
This can be used for testing knot invariants.
Each invariant must produce the same result for each vertex in a connected
component as an invariant must be the same for any two equivalent knot diagrams.
